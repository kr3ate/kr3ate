- 👋 Hi, I’m @kr3ate
- 👀 I’m interested in python and data science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, well refreshing my knowledge in python, and I'm hoping to reignite my learning in data science purely for the fun of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my projects.
- 📫 How to reach me, hmm ... just in this git.
